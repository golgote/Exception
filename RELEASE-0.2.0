- Removed getCause() as it just uses the built in getPrevious() that was added in PHP 5.3
- Removed getUniqueId as it's used anywhere
- Removed toHtml, toText and __toString (which only handled calling the former two).
  People should implement their owny decorator calls.
- Removed the built in outputs of the observer functions. Those where the class constants
  OBSERVER_PRINT, OBSERVER_TRIGGER, OBSERVER_DIE
  This can be achieved by writing a custom callback function, using the appropriate printf(),
  trigger_error and die() to achieve the same result.
- Removed getErroClass and getErrorMethod as it can be easily gotten from getTrace/getTraceSafe first array element
- Add the proper LICENSE file and move Exception.php to the NEW BSD license as the package.xml already defines
