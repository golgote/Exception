- Removed addObserver() / removeObserver() as people can achieve that
  with their own observer function / classes via set_exception_handler
- Removed getTraceSafe() as it was falling back on debug_backtrace()
  when getTrace() was empty, which only happens when an Exception is
  thrown outside of a class/function scope.
