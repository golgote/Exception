PEAR2_Exception is the standard exception class for PEAR2.
In addition to supporting the default signature of the built-in
Exception class, PEAR2_Exception also supports passing a
cause of an exception, which can be another exception object
or a PEAR2_MultiErrors object.  The error messages of the causes
are used when constructing the error message displayed when
converting PEAR2_Exception to a string.
